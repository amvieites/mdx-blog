[Hackmamba](https://hackmamba.io/) is a great resource for creating technical content and strategy. We were excited to partner with them in their 2022 hackathon focused on developing participants technical writing skills.

Learning, writing, and networking during two full weeks! What more could you ask for? This last Hackmamba Jamstack Content Hackathon 2.0. was quite a journey.

The rules were simple: build whatever you want using Xata & Cloudinary and write a blog article about it.

This was a vibrant experience for us at Xata, since we also launched the product the same week as the hackathon. The Hackmamba community and participants were wonderful and built some great apps and content on top of Xata.

Here are the winners:

1. Gift Uhiene https://dev.to/hackmamba/build-a-full-stack-jamstack-application-with-xata-cloudinary-and-nextjs-50pd
2. Johnpaul Eze https://dev.to/hackmamba/modern-e-commerce-with-xata-and-cloudinary-foc
3. Ubaydah Abdulwasiu https://dev.to/hackmamba/how-to-build-an-online-library-in-nextjs-with-xata-and-cloudinary-26b4
