## Blog content for website

This repository holds the source documents used to power our blog in [website-next][0]

## Images

For now, images need to be absolute URLs that point to their raw URL on Github. In a future build of the website, relative images will be pushed to Xata directly.

## Stylistic rules

- Use sentence case
- Keep your description summaries to one short sentence
- Place any assets in the folders in this repo
- Please check the [readme][0] in the website for component usage
