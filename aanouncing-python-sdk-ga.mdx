Xata's initial focus was to enhance the experience for [Jamstack](https://chat.openai.com/blog/jamstack-mern-lamp-stack-comparison#jamstack-and-databases) engineers, resulting in a robust [TypeScript offering](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xata.io/client)
And driven by our enthusiasm for developer engagement, we shortly  introduced a Python SDK, albeit with some basic functionalities. 
Since that initial release, a few things have changed. The world has gone AI-crazy and Python has unofficially become the language of choice for AI/ML. This has coincided with our introduction of vector embeddings and the integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT for your data.
The Python SDK user base has growing steadily and we actively gathered feedback about what users like or dislike.
Today, we are thrilled to announce the [v1.0.0 release](https://pypi.org/project/xata/1.0.0/) of our [Python SDK](/docs/python-sdk/overview).

## PEP-8 FTW!

We received feedback that the SDK didn't feel pythonic, and we couldn’t agree more! Initially, in the `0.x` releases, the API was generated one by one from [our OpenAPI specification](/docs/rest-api/contexts), which resulted in a non-pythonic API. For this release, we have aligned as much as possible with the [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standard.

## Speed improvements

Under the hood, we've made adjustments to how connections are managed and reused. The refactoring has yielded significant performance improvements across the board.The most notable ones include accelerated operation speeds:

| Operation | Speedup (on average)|
| --- | --- |
| Get a single record | 5.95x |
| Insert a single record | 4.95x |
| Insert 100 records with transactions | 2.22x |

## How to migrate to 1.x?

Migrating to a new major version can be tough due to the need to understand the changes that might break things and features that are no longer available. With that in mind, our goal was to minimize the impact while still implementing necessary changes for the greater good. You can check out the [full migration guide](/docs/python-sdk/migration-guide) in our docs.

The most impactful user-facing change is the renaming of the API surface [[xata-py#93](https://github.com/xataio/xata-py/issues/93)]  which has been acknowledged as a breaking change. Additionally, some API endpoint calls were simplified to remove unnecessary code bloat, like creating a database.

Previously in `0.x`, you needed to investigate the payload shape and be specific about the region and branch name.

```python
xata.databases().createDatabase("new_db",
  {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "branchName": "main",
  }
)
```

In version `1.0.*`, we've redesigned the API interface to incorporate payload options directly into the method signature. We've also optimized the SDK's internal values to make assumptions to reuse the SDK internal values, like the `region`. This results in a more streamlined API structure, and you can achieve functionality using:

```python
xata.databases().create("new_db")
```

## What happens to 0.x?

We are going to continue to support the `0.x` version of the Xata Python SDK with maintenance releases for one more year. New API and security fixes will be added but no helpers or other improvements will be backported. The `0.x` product line of the SDK will be sunsetted on September 1st, 2024.

## What’s next?

Check out our [documentation](/docs/python-sdk/migration-guide) and let us know what you think. We’d love to hear from you! If you think something is missing or found a bug, open a ticket in the [xata-py](https://github.com/xataio/xata-py) repository. All contributions are welcome.
