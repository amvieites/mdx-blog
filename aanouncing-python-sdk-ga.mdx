We are thrilled to announce the [1.0.0](https://pypi.org/project/xata/1.0.0/) release of our [Python SDK](https://xata.io/docs/python-sdk/overview).

## Speed improvements

We changed a couple of things under the hood about how connections being managed and reused. The refactoring has yielded significant performance improvements across the board. The most significant ones are:

| Operation | Speedup (on average)|
| --- | --- |
| Get a single record | 5.95x |
| Insert a single record | 4.95x |
| Insert 100 records with transactions | 2.22x |

## PEP-8 FTW!

We received feedback that the SDK didn't not feel pythonic, and we couldn’t agree more! Initially, in the `0.x` releases, the API was generated one by one from [our OpenAPI specification](https://xata.io/docs/rest-api/openapi), which resulted in a non-pythonic API. For this release, we have aligned as much as possible with the [PEP-8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standard.

## How to migrate to 1.x?

Migrating to a new major version can be painful to get up to speed on the breaking changes and dropped functionality. With that in mind, we were trying to minimize the impact while still making necessary changes for the good. You can check out the [full migration guide](https://xata.io/docs/python-sdk/migration-guide) in our docs.

The most impactful user-facing change is the renaming of the API surface [[xata-py#93](https://github.com/xataio/xata-py/issues/93)] and considered a breaking change. Additionally, some API endpoint calls were simplified to remove unnecessary code bloat, like creating a database.

Previously in `0.x`, you needed to investigate the payload shape and be specific about the region and branch name.

```python
xata.databases().createDatabase("new_db",
  {
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "branchName": "main",
  }
)
```

In version `1.0.*`, we've redesigned the API interface to incorporate payload options directly into the method signature. We've also optimized the SDK's internal values to make assumptions to reuse the SDK internal values, like the `region`. This results in a more streamlined API structure, and you can achieve functionality using:

```python
xata.databases().create("new_db")
```

## What happens to 0.x?

We are going to continue to support the `0.x` version of the Xata Python SDK with maintenance releases for one more year. New API and security fixes will be added but no helpers or other improvements will be backported. The `0.x` product line of the SDK will be sunsetted on September 1st, 2024.

## What’s next?

Check out our [documentation](https://xata.io/docs/python-sdk/migration-guide) and let us know what you think. We’d love to hear from you! If you think something is missing or found a bug, open a ticket in the [xata-py](https://github.com/xataio/xata-py) repository. All contributions are welcome.
